Dockerfile is part of a process to build Docker images, which are part of containers, while Docker Compose is used for orchestrating

The Dockerfile is used to build images while the docker-compose. yaml file is used to run images. The Dockerfile uses the docker build command, while the docker-compose. yaml file uses the docker-compose up command



YAML is a human-readable text-based format that lets you easily specify configuration-type information by using a combination of maps of name-value pairs and lists of items (and nested versions of each)

YAML is better suitable for configuration than JSON, whereas JSON is suitable for serialization format and transferring the data for API. JSON is good for human readability and suitable for serialization. It is explicit and can transmit the data over HTTP.


A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image whereas Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment. It gets an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up. Docker compose uses the Dockerfile if you add the build command to your projectâ€™s docker-compose.yml. Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable Dockerfile for each image you wish to create, then use compose to assemble the images using the build command.
